Check out some of the projects I've completed and summarized here. More details about each project can be found by clicking the project link or by choosing it from the drop down column on the left.

## [Finnish to English Neural Machine Translation Models](/projects/nmt.md)
See project details here
- Collected and preprocessed corpora data for models using OpusFilter
- Trained and evaluated 3 Finnish to English NMT Transformer models using OpenNMTâ€‘py (Base Transformer, Multilingual, and Fine-tuned Models)


## [Predicting Weather Events with Machine Learning Models](./ml.md)
See the project report [here](../docs/Machine_Learning_Project_Group93.pdf)
- Partnered with two classmates to train a binary and multi-class classifier on a data set of atmospheric measurements
- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the problem and implemented statistical and unsupervised feature selection methods
- Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers for the binary and multi-class task, accommodating an imbalanced set for the multi-class task

## [Neural Morphological Analyzer for Inuktitut](./compmorph.md)
See project details here
- Used Inuktitut data and OpenNMT-py to create, machine translation inspired, Neural Morphological Analyzers and Generators for Inuktitut

## Text Classification with ArXiv
- Processed ArXiv abstracts using scikit-learn and NLTK
- Trained and optimized KNN model using scikit-learn to classify between 19 document categories
