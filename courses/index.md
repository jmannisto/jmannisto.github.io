Below is more detailed description of the courses I've taken during the course of my Masters degree at the University of Helsinki.
## Currently In Progress
### Computational Semantics (Period 3, Winter 2023)
- Covered fundamentals of Word Sense Disambiguation, Sentiment Analysis, Representation Learning, and Information Extraction theory and applications

### Introduction to Deep Learning (Period 3, Winter 2023)
- Implement CNNs and RNNs using PyTorch in course assignments
- Establish strong foundation in Neural Network theory
- Final course project underway in image classification

## Completed Courses
### Neural Machine Translation (Period 2, Autumn 2022)
- Trained, fine-tuned, and evaluated mono- and multilingual NMT models using OpenNMT-py, including RNN with and without attention and Transformer architectures
- Collected, aligned, and preprocessed text and corpora , ranging from thousands to millions of lines, for translation models using tools such as OpusFilter
- Gained familiarity with common architectures: sequence-to-sequence, attention, and Transformers and discussed the many challenges currently in the field
- For the final project, created 3 types of Transformer models with various techniques implemented to improve upon the previous model's performance on translating from Finnish to English (see Projects)

### Intro to Machine Learning (Period 2, Autumn 2022):
- Implemented supervised and unsupervised machine learning models using Python and scikit-learn
- Acquired hands on experience of fundamental machine learning principles and concepts such as feature selection, model selection, parameter tuning, loss functions, bias-variance trade-off, etc.
- For the final project, partnered with two classmates to train a binary and multi-class classifier on a data set of atmospheric measurements (see Projects)

### Computational Morphology (Period 2, Autumn 2022):
- Used finite-state automata and transducers (specifically the (hfst toolkit)[https://hfst.github.io/]) to build morphological lexica and morpho-phonological rules
- Covered models and methods for automatic morphological analysis and generation including rule-based finite-state technology as well as supervised and unsupervised methods
- Practiced designing computational models of morphology while taking into account the diversity and difference of morphological structures in different languages
- Final project used supervised learning methods to create a morphological analyzer and generator for Inuktitut (see Projects)

### Intro to Data Science (Period 1, Autumn 2022):
- Covered the life cycle of a Data Science project including
  - data collection
  - data preprocessing and wrangling (including various data formats and data types)
  - data management (including the considerations for: databases, accessibility, sharing, governance, ethics and privacy)
  - fundamentals of exploratory data analysis
  - presentation and visualizations of findings
- Final project was text classification of ArXiv documents (see Projects)

### Command Line for Linguists (Period 1, Autumn 2022):

## Courses Planned for Spring 2023
### Advanced Machine learning
### Approaches to Natural Language Understanding
### Computational Syntax
